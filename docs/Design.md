## Classes
* Main
* Sonnet

## Design Process
Everything starts in the Main Class and in the Main class we make 
a Sonnet object which holds stuff related to the sonnet problem .However, 
different methods are used to split the problem into separate steps
for example, we use a splitStringToWords static method in Main class
