## Classes
* Main
* Sonnet

## Design Process
Everything starts in the Main Class and in the Main class we make 
a Sonnet object which holds stuff related to the sonnet problem .However, 
different methods are used to split the problem into separate steps with splitStringToWords
being static inside main, with Sonnet class holding other methods used to split the problem([check this link](./classes/Sonnet.md)).
